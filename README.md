# SmartBlox Ingestion Service

This is a robust Go service designed to continuously ingest data from the SmartBlox blockchain network. It identifies asset transfer transactions (`txfer`), persists them to a MongoDB database, and maintains running metrics about the transfers.

The service is built with a focus on robustness and performance, featuring stateful recovery, graceful shutdowns, and concurrent backfilling to process historical data efficiently.

-----

## âœ¨ Features

  * **Concurrent Backfill**: Uses a worker pool to quickly catch up on blocks missed during downtime.
  * **MongoDB Persistence**: Stores all transactions and running metrics in a scalable MongoDB database.
  * **Idempotent Writes**: A unique index on transaction signatures prevents duplicate data during reprocessing.
  * **Stateful Recovery**: Gracefully recovers from crashes by loading its last known state and backfilling any gaps.
  * **Graceful Shutdown**: Listens for OS signals to ensure the final state is saved before exiting.
  * **Clean Architecture**: Decoupled components using interfaces make the code testable and maintainable.

## ðŸš€ Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get the project running on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

You'll need to have the following software installed:

  * [**Go**](https://go.dev/doc/install) (version 1.24 or higher)
  * [**Docker**](https://www.docker.com/get-started) and **Docker Compose**

### Installation & Running

1.  **Clone the Repository**

```bash
cd smartblox-ingestor
```

2.  **Start the Database**
    Launch the MongoDB container in the background using Docker Compose.

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

    This will start a MongoDB instance and expose it on `localhost:27017`.

3.  **Set Up Environment**
    The application reads the MongoDB connection string from the `MONGO_URI` environment variable. If it's not set, it defaults to `mongodb://localhost:27017`.

    If your database is elsewhere, set the variable in .env file:

```bash
MONGO_URI="mongodb://user:pass@host:port"
```

4.  **Install Dependencies**
Tidy the Go modules to ensure all dependencies are downloaded and consistent.

```bash
go mod tidy
```

5.  **Run the Application**
    Execute the main program. The service will connect to the database, backfill historical blocks, and begin polling for new ones.

```bash
go run .
```

    You will see log output in your terminal. To stop the service, press `Ctrl+C`.

## ðŸ”¬ Verifying the Data

You can connect directly to the database to see the data being ingested.

1.  **Run Queries**
    Inside the `mongosh` prompt, you can run the following commands:

```javascript
// Switch to the application's database
use smartblox;

// View the singleton metrics document
db.metrics.findOne();

// View a few of the stored transactions, formatted nicely
db.transactions.find().limit(5).pretty();

// Count the total number of ingested transactions
db.transactions.countDocuments();
```

-----

## âœ… Running Tests

To run the unit tests for the project, execute the following command from the processor directory:

```bash
cd processor
go test ./...
```

## ðŸ“‚ Project Structure

The project is organized into several packages to separate concerns:

```
.
â”œâ”€â”€ client/          # Handles communication with the external blockchain API.
â”œâ”€â”€ persistence/     # Manages all database interactions (MongoDB implementation).
â”œâ”€â”€ processor/       # Contains the core business logic for processing blocks.
â”œâ”€â”€ types/           # Defines all shared data structures (Block, Transaction, Metrics).
â”œâ”€â”€ config/          # Small helpers for reading configuration.
â”œâ”€â”€ main.go          # The application entry point and orchestrator.
â”œâ”€â”€ go.mod           # Go module definition and dependencies.
â”œâ”€â”€ docker-compose.yml # Docker configuration for the MongoDB database.
â””â”€â”€ README.md        # This file.
